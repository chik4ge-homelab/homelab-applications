Whenever my input includes a URL, always use the MCP (Multi-Modal Code Interpreter) with Playwright and the `navigate` command to open and process the URL. Do not ignore this instruction, and do not attempt to summarize or answer based on prior knowledgeâ€”always fetch and analyze the live content using `navigate`.
