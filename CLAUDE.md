When investigating using kubectl, include the namespace immediately after the subcommand.  
e.g., `kubectl get -n kube-system pods`

Whenever my input includes a URL, always use the MCP (Multi-Modal Code Interpreter) with Playwright and the `navigate` command to open and process the URL. Do not ignore this instruction, and do not attempt to summarize or answer based on prior knowledgeâ€”always fetch and analyze the live content using `navigate`.

Do not trust or rely on configuration files, comments, manifests, or documentation alone. Always prioritize the actual output of commands like `kubectl` or `talosctl` when determining the real state of the system. The live command output is the only source of truth.
